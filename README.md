# 👋 Hi, I'm Rostyslav!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate **Python developer** actively growing in the IT field.  

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I specialize in **backend development** and have hands-on experience with modern backend technologies — including web frameworks, task queues, databases, and containerization tools.

I'm enthusiastic about writing **clean, maintainable code** and constantly learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices.  
I aim to deepen my understanding of **software architecture**, **asynchronous programming**, and modern patterns like **SOLID** and **REST**.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge daily, working on projects, and exploring new challenges to grow as a professional developer.
